[00:20.20] What up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
[00:22.55] When the cops came, you shoulda slid to my crib
[00:25.30] Fuck it, black, no time for looking back it's done
[00:27.92] Plus congratulations, you know you got a son
[00:30.29] I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?
[00:33.22] Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
[00:59.22] 
[00:35.82] Flippin', talk about he acts too rough
[00:38.40] He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
[00:40.44] I was like, "Yeah", shorty don't care, she a snake too
[00:43.25] Fuckin' with the niggas from that fake crew that hate you
[00:46.40] But yo', guess who got shot in the dome-piece
[00:48.63] Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones beach, it's bugged
[00:51.73] Plus little Rob is selling drugs on the dime
[00:54.65] Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
[01:18.15] 
[00:56.73] And night time is more trife than ever
[00:59.26] What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
[01:01.20] If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
[01:04.69] Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
[01:06.86] I left a half a hundred in your commissary
[01:09.19] You was my nigga when push came to shove
[01:11.19] (One what?) One love
[01:21.19] 
[01:12.15] One love, one love, one love, one love
[01:15.94] One love, one love, one love, one love
[01:21.35] One love, one love, one love, one love
[01:27.34] One love, one love, one love, one love
[01:46.34] 
[01:32.34] Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
[01:34.78] Out in New York, the same shit is goin' on
[01:37.75] The crack-heads stalkin', loud-mouths is talkin'
[01:40.11] Hold, check out the story yesterday, when I was walkin'
[01:42.58] The nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin' somethin'
[01:46.22] Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
[01:47.93] And he be pumpin' on your block
[01:49.34] Your man gave him your Glock
[01:51.27] And now they run together, what up son? Whatever
[02:15.27] 
[01:53.17] Since I'm on the streets, I'ma put it to a cease
[01:55.59] But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
[01:57.98] Wilin' on the island, but now in Elmira
[02:00.72] Better chill, 'cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
[02:03.22] Last time you wrote you said, they tried you in the showers
[02:05.79] But maintain when you come home, the corner's ours
[02:08.49] On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
[02:11.10] When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
[02:40.60] 
[02:13.50] But chill, see you on the next V-I
[02:16.27] I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent ya flicks
[02:18.84] Your brother's buck wilin' in four Maine, he wrote me
[02:21.66] He might beat his case, 'til he come home I'll play it low key
[02:52.66] 
[02:23.92] So stay civilised, time flies
[02:26.55] Though incarcerated, your mind dies
[02:28.16] I hate it when your moms cries
[02:29.49] It kinda wants to make me murder, for reala
[02:31.78] I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love
[02:59.78] 
[02:34.66] One love, one love, one love, one love
[02:38.87] One love, one love, one love, one love
[02:44.67] One love, one love, one love, one love
[02:50.02] One love, one love, one love, one love
[03:09.02] 
[02:54.61] Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
[02:57.55] Mind's in another world thinkin'
[02:58.84] "How can we exist through the facts?"
[03:00.49] Written in school text books, Bibles, etcetera
[03:02.86] Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed
[03:05.40] So I be ghost for my projects
[03:07.62] I take my pen and pad for the weekend
[03:09.29] Hittin' Ls while I'm sleepin'
[03:10.44] A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone
[03:13.09] To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
[03:36.09] 
[03:15.75] You see the streets have me stressed somethin' terrible
[03:18.43] Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
[03:20.97] Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to ten
[03:23.27] A future in a maximum state pen is grim
[03:25.95] So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
[03:29.16] Rollin' two phillies together, in the Bridge we call 'em "oo-wops"
[04:02.16] 
[03:30.96] He said, "Nas, niggas cold be bustin' off the roof
[03:33.86] So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tres-deuce"
[03:35.36] He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
[03:39.42] Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
[03:41.89] I sat back like the mack, my army suit was black
[03:43.74] We was chillin' on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
[04:16.24] 
[03:46.75] I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
[03:49.44] Keeps me blasted, he starts talkin' mad shit
[03:51.99] I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
[03:54.74] 'Cause when the pistol blows the one that's murdered be the cool one
[03:57.03] Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
[03:59.54] Could've caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
[04:02.40] Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
[04:04.98] At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
[04:31.98] 
[04:07.18] Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
[04:09.52] Only 12 trying to tell me that he liked my style
[04:12.33] Then I rose, wipin' the blunts ash from my clothes
[04:14.83] Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
[04:17.72] And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze
[04:20.19] Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
[04:23.01] Words of wisdom from Nas, try to rise up above
[04:25.63] Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love
[04:48.63] 
[04:27.87] One love, one love, one love, one love
[04:33.26] One love, one love, one love, one love
[04:37.82] One love, one love, one love, one love
[04:42.43] One love, one love, one love, one love
[04:47.79] One love, one love, one love, one love
[04:53.60] One love, one love, one love, one love
[04:59.21] One love, one love, one love, one love
[05:04.34] One love, one love, one love, one love
[05:09.36] One love, one love, one love, one love
[05:14.26] One love, one love, one love, one love
[05:19.39] One love
